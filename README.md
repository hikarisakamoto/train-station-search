# Train Station Search
Simple implementations for a Train Station Search Engine

Using Java 11 and Springboot Framework 

## Test Covarage
Service layer is covered by unit tests.
Integration test would be next step.

## Some other considerations
For this simple approach would we could update to Quarkus using GraalVM as it would make the API much lighter and faster.

Replacing hardcoded stations will be easy and recommended with actual implementation, and leave this simple search algorithm to the database.
